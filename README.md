# üí´ About Me:
How to eliminate overengineering without adding spaghetti code with the best programmer and thinker in Central America. Carlos Alonzo.<br><br>I consider myself a problem solver, I always analyze any issue in the developing process, find the root cause of the problem and design a solution for it, during all my years of experience I had developed the natural ability of fast adaptation for any new project and the challenges that it might bring over to the table, the reason why I do not rest until reaching the highest level of quality, I am addicted to success.<br><br>My areas of specialization are Laravel, React, and Vue by using these tools I had opened my road during all these years of experience making possible what looked to be impossible to materialize from the idea of my customers this is a clear example of that; Booking Spot for Players (PHP + Laravel + jQuery + React): consists of a customer being able to purchase N number of spots in a game. The payment was requested with Moneris API (accepting MasterCard, VISA credit/debit cards). In the provider panel, can offer their facilities or locations for hosting a game. Can create future games, delete or update them.<br><br>just allow me a couple of minutes of your time to talk to you about my goals and experience.<br>These are the goals that I always have in mind every time that a project or task is assigned to me, first of all, I make a list of the requirements to determine the desired range of the project, after that I Plan all the scopes based on the time required, by this point is necessary to take some time to think how to avoid and manage any problem or issue on the developing process, is necessary to keep a well-organized structure on the project itself and a fluent communication with my customer to be able to deliver progress on a regular basis and finally but not less important my final goal to accomplish success is Checking the results with the right tools making sure in that way the final product to be deliver is exactly what the customer wanted and with best quality ever.<br><br>My experience has been and long road, full of learning opportunities and knowledge gains that have sharped and shaped into the kind of professional that I am right now, Specialized in business, commercial, Logistic (Reservations systems), financial systems (Financial report systems, Payment systems), shopping systems and Admin systems. (Corporate documents storage systems).<br><br>Between less effort is invested in improving our skills less of a programmer we can be called Read it, learn it, apply it, read more, learn more and Evolve, never stop in the quest for excellence.
